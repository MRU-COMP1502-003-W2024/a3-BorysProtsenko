            <section>
                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Born in Ukraine and now pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems in Canada. A passionate hockey fan and former player, I am now focused on becoming a software developer.</p>
                <p>
                    I was raised in a city called Kiev, a beautiful place that has one of the most beautiful places called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_of_Love_(railway)" target="_blank"><b><u>Tunnel Of Love</u></b></a>. You can see a puzzle picture down below. I personally never was there as I was too young for love so never went there. Anyways, I moved here to Canada and now live in Calgary. The main reason why my family decided to move here is the quality of life and the opportunities that await me. I am really excited about what the world has to offer to me and ready to live a fulfilling life.
